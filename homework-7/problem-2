  Asymptotic Running Time: O(NlogN)
b.
  Asymptotic Running Time: O(NlogN)
c.
  The asymptotic running times are the same because both cases are a best case
    scenario for quick sort, since partitioning always divides the array in
    half, but input (a), ie, sorted input, will run faster because no
    rearranging of elements into greater and lesser subarrays or swapping of
    elements or arrays has to take place once the array is partitioned
