#datastructures
a collection of homework (and notes) from my Data Structures class

The programs are really the only interesting part, but I had it all in the same folder so it's easier to just back it all up to the same place anyway.

Of particular interest, check out homework 8, where I created a program to compare the running times of the heapsort, quicksort and mergesort algorithms on variously sized arrays in already sorted, reverse sorted, and random order.  Sort contains the algorithms themselves, and Reporting runs them under different conditions.  To make my report extra nice, I created a python script to graph the results.
