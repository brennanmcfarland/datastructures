1. As in quick sort, maintain indices i and j starting i just before the start
    of the array and j just after the end
2. increment i until it is pointing at a blue element
3. decrement j until it is pointing at a red element
4. swap the objects i and j are pointing to in the array
5. repeat 2-4 until i and j meet or cross
