a.
  when V=N, E[min]=N-1
  by its definition a cyclic graph must contain a path connecting distinct edges
    that starts and ends at the same vertex; thus if any one edge in that path
    is removed, the graph is still connected by the other edge as in a cyclic
    graph there must be a way to and from every node, thus the graph with the
    minimum possible number of edges to still be connected cannot be cyclic
  OR
  suppose the graph with the smallest possible number of edges is cyclic; if any
    edge (a,b) is removed, the graph is still connected because the graph can be
    traversed by starting at vertex a and traversing to b, or vice versa, so it
    cannot be a graph with the smallest number of edges, which is a
    contradiction to the supposition, thus a graph with the smallest possible
    number of edges must be acyclic
b.
  when V=N, E[max]=N(N-1)/2
  suppose a graph with the largest possible number of edges is incomplete, then
    if an additional edge is added between any two formerly non-adjacent
    vertices, which I will call (a,b) for clarity, then the graph containing
    edge (a,b) has more edges than what we had supposed to be the graph with the
    largest possible number of edges, which is a contradiction, thus the graph
    with the largest possible number of edges must be complete
