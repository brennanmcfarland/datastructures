FINAL - INFO
  best way to review is go over assignments you lost points on
  right here (DeGrace 312)
  will be allowed 1 sheet as usual
  designed to be about 2x as long as a regular exam
FINAL - REVIEW
  1. ADT: abstract model of how to interact with a particular data structure
    concretized by an interface
    not the data structure itself, but a conceptualization of it
  2. List: collection of items, often ordered in some particular way
    -ArrayList - random access
    -LinkedList - dynamically resizeable
    -UML:
      storage
      int size

      void add(object)
      object remove()
      int size()
      object peek/get(int)
      Iterator(Comparator)
        boolean hasNext()
        object next()
  3. "Special Lists"
    -Stack - LIFO
      -postfix notation
    -Queue - FIFO
  4. Evaluating Complexity
    -time - F(N), online (continuous stream of data)
      -steps
    -space
  5. O notation: behavior at the limit at finity
    -growth rate function
    -worst case
    -types of growth: polynomial, logarithmic, factorial(exponential)
    -determining from code+loops (make sure you know logarithmic identities)
  6. Trees/Recursion
    1. binary trees: each node has up to 2 children
      leaf: no children, root: beginning of tree, no parent in that tree
      complete: all leaves @ same depth AND all nodes but leaves have 2 children
      full: nodes filled in L-R with no gaps
      depth, height, balance
    (2. B-trees, don't forget B-trees!)
  and so on ...
